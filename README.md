# Pistol
Hits much harder than normal doom's pistol and is perfectly accurate. Great for long range engagements.
# Shotgun
Much stronger and has a tight spread. Good for ranged combat.
# Chaingun
Mild spin-up time before firing. Hits more often and harder some of the time, good choice for up close and mid-range weapon.
# Rocket Launcher
Everybody's favorite spam-cannon just got faster! Rockets travel 10% faster.
# Plasma Rifle
Now fills the "area denial" role with a very high fire rate but the same damage per second.

# Fist and Chainsaw
Beefed up to very quickly destroy enemies. 2-3 punches, very brief chainsaw contact.

# Overall
All weapons, except the BFG9000 and Plasma Rifle now switch almost instantly for more fluid and varied fights.
